I am a PhD student in the [Neuroengineering Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ramdya-lab/) at EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. I am interested in reverse-engineering the neural controller underlying the agile and robust locomotion of animals. To do so, I build biologically constrained artificial neural networks to reproduce the behavior of the common fruit fly, _Drosophila_. I hope these models will teach us about fundamental neurobiology and inspire more efficient control architecture for robotics and AI. I am a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds](https://www.bifonds.de/) PhD fellow.

Before my PhD, I worked at [Habiterre](https://www.habiterre.com/), a company devoted to ecosystems modeling and sustainability benchmarking. I led an [NSF-funded project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2026071) that systematically evaluates farmland resilience using satellite images and machine learning. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I enjoy hiking, skiing, and chilling with my dog. I am a vexillology enthusiast, a train nerd, and a general curator of random information.
