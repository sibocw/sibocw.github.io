I am a PhD candidate at the [Neuroengineering Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ramdya-lab/) at EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. I am interested in reverse-engineering the neural controller underlying agile and robust animal behaviors. Specifically, I build biologically constrained artificial neural networks to reproduce the behavior of _Drosophila_, the common fruit fly. I hope these models will teach us about fundamental neurobiology and inspire more efficient control architectures for robotics and AI. I am a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds](https://www.bifonds.de/) PhD fellow.

Before my PhD, I worked at [Habiterre](https://www.habiterre.com/), a company devoted to ecosystems modeling and sustainability benchmarking. I led an [NSF-funded project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2026071) on systematically evaluating farmland resilience using satellite images and machine learning. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

### Highlights
- 2023: **Fruit fly digital twin:** I'm excited to share [NeuroMechFly v2](https://neuromechfly.org/), our framework for simulating embodied sensorimotor control in adult _Drosophila_, now accepted at _Nature Methods_. [Preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.18.556649).
- 2023: **Descending neuron networks:** I'm honored to be a part of our study on how networks of descending neurons transform command-like signals into population-based behavioral control, now [published in _Nature_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07523-9).
- 2019–2021: **[HabiTerre](https://www.habiterre.com/)**, a company devoted to sustainable agriculture utilizing satellite images and machine learning. I served as HabiTerre's CRO in its first two years.
- 2017–2018: **Gravitational astrophysics**: I have also briefly worked on simulating gravitational waves and building deep learning models for observational astronomy. See my CV for publications.
