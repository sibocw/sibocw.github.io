I am a PhD student in the [Neuroengineering Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ramdya-lab/) at EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne. I am interested in reverse-engineering the neural controller underlying agile and robust animal behaviors. Specifically, I build biologically constrained artificial neural networks to reproduce the behavior of _Drosophila_, the common fruit fly. I hope these models will teach us about fundamental neurobiology and inspire more efficient control architecture for robotics and AI. I am a [Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds](https://www.bifonds.de/) PhD fellow.

Before my PhD, I worked at [Habiterre](https://www.habiterre.com/), a company devoted to ecosystems modeling and sustainability benchmarking. I led an [NSF-funded project](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2026071) that systematically evaluates farmland resilience using satellite images and machine learning. I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

### Highlights
- **Fruit fly digital twin:** I'm excited to share NeuroMechFly 2.0, our framework for simulating embodied sensorimotor control in adult _Drosophila_. [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.18.556649). [Website](https://neuromechfly.org/).
- **Descending neuron networks:** I'm honored to be a part of our study on how [networks of descending neurons transform command-like signals into population-based behavioral control](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.11.557103)
- **Before neuroscience:** I'm proud to have been the first employee of [HabiTerre](http://habiterre.com/), a company offering a holistic approach to farm productivity and resource use efficiency, empowered by satellite data and machine learning. I'm honored to have served as HabiTerre's CRO during its foundational two years (2019â€“2021).
