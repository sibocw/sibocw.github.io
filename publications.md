## Publications

### Online resources
- [NeuroMechFly](https://neuromechfly.org/) documentation, complete with tutorials and a [workshop recording](https://neuromechfly.org/workshop).
- I wrote a [tutorial on doing machine learning with custom datasets and using transfer learning to facilitate training](https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/knowledge-base/blob/main/code_tutorials/torch-dataset-demo/torch_demo.ipynb)
- I wrote a [tutorial on processing geospatial data with Python](https://github.com/yzh5239/geospatial-quickstart/blob/master/notebooks/1hr-cookbook.ipynb) (Caveat: As I wrote this tutorial quite a while ago, it might not follow current best practices. Also, know that I was only a master student when I wrote it.)
