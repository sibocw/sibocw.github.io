## École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)
- [BIOENG 456: Controlling behavior in animals and robots](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/controlling-behavior-in-animals-and-robots-BIOENG-456). 2022--2023.
  - Teaching Assistant / Lead Teaching Assistant (I designed the course projects, one of which led to [NeuroMechFly 2.0](https://neuromechfly.org/)).
  - Students acquire an integrative view on biological and artificial algorithms for controlling autonomous behaviors.
- [BIO 311: Neuroscience](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/neuroscience-BIO-311). 2022.
  - Teaching Assistant.
  - The course starts with fundamentals of electrical - and chemical signaling in neurons. Students then learn how neurons in the brain receive and process sensory information, and how other neurons control the behavior of an animal. Furthermore, memory, learning, and brain disorders are introduced.
