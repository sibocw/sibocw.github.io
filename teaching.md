## Teaching

### École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)
- [BIOENG 456: Controlling behavior in animals and robots](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/controlling-behavior-in-animals-and-robots-BIOENG-456). 2022--2023.
  - Master course in Life Sciences and Robotics.
  - Teaching Assistant / Lead Teaching Assistant (I designed the course projects, one of which led to [NeuroMechFly 2.0](https://neuromechfly.org/)).
  - Students acquire an integrative view on biological and artificial algorithms for controlling autonomous behaviors.
- [BIO 311: Neuroscience](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/neuroscience-BIO-311). 2022.
  - Third-year-bachelor/first-year-master course in Life Sciences.
  - Teaching Assistant.
  - The course starts with fundamentals of electrical - and chemical signaling in neurons. Students then learn how neurons in the brain receive and process sensory information, and how other neurons control the behavior of an animal. Furthermore, memory, learning, and brain disorders are introduced.

### University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)
- [CS 241: System Programming](https://github.com/illinois-cs241/coursebook). 2017--2018.
  - Second/third-year bachelor course in Computer Science.
  - Teaching Assistant.
  - Basics of system programming, including POSIX processes, process control, inter-process communication, synchronization, signals, simple memory management, file I/O and directories, shell programming, socket network programming, RPC programming in distributed systems, basic security mechanisms, and standard tools for systems programming such as debugging tools. ([Source](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs241-120182))

### Student supervision
- I have supervised 7 master student projects/internships (part-time projects lasting one semester, or full-time projects lasting part of the summer), 5 bachelor student projects (similar in format), and 1 master thesis project.
